# soccer-analytics-with-python-mongoDB-and-R
Using **Python**, **R** and **NoSQL** for pipeline structure

- The project is On-going... and would be updated here accordingly.

This project is an idea put at work on pipe-lining individual tools/languages and skills for extracting the maximum capabilities of each of them. The languages used are `Python`, `NoSQl`, and `R` programming. 

> As we know *Python* is primarily a scripting language that is highly proficient with data extraction, manipulation and web development. Here we use it for capturing structured and unstructured data from the web and aligning it to a specific format that is easy to work with. This structured data is then forwarded to the NoSQL database connection with *mongoDB* for data management and updating as and when required. This data then further follows with *R* programming, by connecting the database from the other end to create a virtual pipeline flow. The data thus imported into R, would be used for performing explanatory data analysis and predictions, ranging from both descriptive data analysis to prescriptive analysis with focus on obtaining the summary statistics from multiple variables (principal variables) and applying the efficient and apt models after testing for accuracy. 

- The end goals considered for this project are finding the 

**The top scorers by the end of the season**


**The top teams most likely to make it to Top 4 spots and qualify for Champions league and Europa league.**

- The teams data selected for this purpose is restricted to Laliga, which is the Spanish competition between 20 Division-I teams. Shiny web development (which is an integration with R software provides excellent highly resourceful visualization for the end results as well for reporting, and hence would also be incorporated with it)
