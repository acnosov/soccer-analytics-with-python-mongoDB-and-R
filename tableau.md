In an attempt to learn about the data and make some insightful consideration or assumption, I decided to use  `tableau public`.

We will discuss some of the workbook images below.

- We first start with the games won, drawn or lost by home team vs away teams for each year (over the entire dataset), head-to-head results.

- when the away team wins, the average number shots attempted on goal(target) has been 5.2 in response to home team attempting 
around 3.9 on average. For home team winning the average shots on target has been 6.16 in response to 3.2 by away team. 
While game ending in favor of draw saw, 3.6 attempts on target by away team to 4.3 by home team. This shows home team needed to 
have more shots on target than away team for a favorable result.

- It shows distinct number of red cards gained by each team. If the red cards are more for home team, they usually end up lossing, but there is an exciting insights attached with it, which is when the team playing home is **strong** and has more red cards than away team (weaker team), they still end up winning, which shows the strength of the team in overall attempts to goals compensates for the fouls and red cards. Also, another interesting theory attached to it is that red cards could be made towards he end of the game, so it might not play such big part in determining the conclusion of the match (however in some occasions only)

- If the average full time goals, for the away team is more than 2(on an average), historical data shows that team away team ends up winning, provided teh home team scores 1 or less. 
- If avergae full time goals is 2 or more home team and conversly about .50 for away team the home team wins.
- Chances of draw, as we could think of, is high when both team score same number of goals. Most times, it is 1.508 on average for both teams.
