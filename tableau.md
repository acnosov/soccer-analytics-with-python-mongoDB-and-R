In an attempt to learn about the data and make some insightful consideration or assumption, I decided to use  `tableau public`.



- when the away team wins, the average number shots attempted on goal(target) has been 5.2 in response to home team attempting 
around 3.9 on average. For home team winning the average shots on target has been 6.16 in response to 3.2 by away team. 
While game ending in favor of draw saw, 3.6 attempts on target by away team to 4.3 by home team. This shows home team needed to 
have more shots on target than away team for a favorable result.
